    <h1>Character</h1>
    <p>The heroine is probably intelligent, and more progressive than others in the movie. She likely is against marriage at the start of the film before inevitably
        becoming one of a love triangle. By the end of the film, she will fall in love with the obvious better choice. She is likely wealthy and in love with someone wealthier. She may have 
        siblings, but they only exist to show how caring she is or cause other issues with the plot.
